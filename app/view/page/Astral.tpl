                </header>

                <p>I currently work as a Youth Services Librarian at <a href="https://www.sjpl.org/teenhq">TeenHQ</a>, the teen center in downtown San Jose.  I deliver programming for teens, oversee the makerspace, and work with cutting edge technology such as VR.  Previously, I worked at a branch where I did programming for people of all ages and managed the Young Adult and Adult Collections.  In addition, I have experience in archives, teaching, writing, public speaking, working with geographically dispersed teammates and intercultural communication.  Please see below for examples of some of my work.</p>

                <h3><a href="https://www.sjpl.org/blog/virtual-reality-library">VR at the Library</a></h3>
                <p>I am part of the team that implemented the use of VR in the San Jose Public Library.</p>

                <p>A paper I wrote for a class about why online dating is an information problem.  It was published in the Winter 2015 academic edition of <i><a href="https://issuu.com/circulationmag/docs/winter_2015">Circulation</a></i>, the University of Washington iSchool's student magazine.  It was also featured on <i>The Information</i>, the official blog of the Information School.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://blogs.sfzc.org/blog/2014/08/12/warm-present-history-archivists-tribute/">Archiving at the San Francisco Zen Center</a></h3>
                <p>I spent a month during Summer 2014 working as an archives intern at the San Francisco Zen Center with nine other UW students.  Our goal was to archive and digitize the Zen Center's historical documents.  We worked with the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley where the Zen Center Collection will be housed.  To gain a better understanding of the organization, we lived and worked with the Zen Center community and followed Zen Buddhist practices.</p>

                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                </header>

                <p>A native of Northeast Ohio, I graduated cum laude from Kent State University with a BA in International Relations. After graduation, I headed to Japan on the JET Program and started working as an English teacher in Suzuka, Japan at a high school with a multinational student body. It was an invaluable experience, and I loved working with students and living in another culture. However, my lifelong love of learning and sharing information led me to embark on the path to library and information science.  In 2015, I graduated from the University of Washington and began a career as a librarian with the San Jose Public Library.

                <p>In my free time, I enjoy traveling and exploring new places, cooking, watching movies, and relaxing in caf√©s. I'm a voracious reader, but especially love sci-fi, fantasy and young adult fiction. True to the librarian stereotype, I love cats and sometimes wear my hair in a bun.</p>
