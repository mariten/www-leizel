==============================================
**leizel-www** is a small PHP/Smarty system that powers a [personal website for Leizel](http://leizel.mariten.com)

## Features
#### Technologies Used
* PHP 5.4
* Smarty 2
* Apache 2.2
* Page design based on [**Astral**](http://html5up.net/astral) by [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) (with a number of locally-made CSS customizations)
  * Utilizes [Skel](https://github.com/n33/skel) JS and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) for social button glyphs

## Setup
1. Ensure `tmp/template_c` (where compiled Smarty templates go) is writable by the web server
2. Point the **DocumentRoot** for Apache to the `www` folder - [index.php](www/index.php) in that folder handles all requests

## Credits
* Thanks to @n33 for the great design skeletons at http://html5up.net
