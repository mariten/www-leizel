==============================================
**leizel-www** is a small PHP/Smarty system that powers a [personal website for Leizel](http://leizel.mariten.com)

## Features
#### Technologies Used
* PHP 5.4 :elephant:
* Smarty 2
* Apache 2.2
* Page design based on [**Astral**](http://html5up.net/astral) by [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net) (with a number of locally-made CSS customizations)
  * Utilizes [Skel](https://github.com/n33/skel) JS and [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) for social button glyphs

## Setup
1. Ensure that temp file directories exist and are writable by the web server
    * `tmp/template_c` - where compiled Smarty templates live
2. Point the **DocumentRoot** for Apache to the `www` folder - [index.php](www/index.php) in that folder handles all requests
